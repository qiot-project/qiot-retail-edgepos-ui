# qiot-retail-edgepos-ui

This is a simple UI, built from typescript, a simple stylesheet and similar assets. Build it with `npm build`, and then copy the resources into the project: `qiot-retail-edgepos` under `src/main/resources/META-INT/resources/`.

You can easily develop this UI under localhost by running `npm run-scripts serve`.
